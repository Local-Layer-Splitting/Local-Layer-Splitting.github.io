# Local Layer Splitting G-code Generator

## Description

Local Layer Splitting (LLS) is a silicone 3D printing method that uses a variation in layer height to generate pneumatic actuators. The variation in layer height, using the same printing nozzle, results in a variation in the mechanical properties of the printed material (tensile strength). The LLS method utilizes this variation in mechanical properties to create pneumatic actuators whose deformation is defined by the printing process rather than the shape.

This page is a user guide for the Grasshopper G-code generator, which allows the printing of pneumatic actuators with multiple layer heights. The generator is currently functional with tube shapes, but it is not guaranteed to work with other shapes without adjustments.

For more information on LLS, please refer to the corresponding paper : DOI = ....
